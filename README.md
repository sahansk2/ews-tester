# EWS Test-runner
![Preview of EWS Tester Result](./ews-tester.png)
For testing your code on UIUC's EWS without ssh'ing into it all the time.

This code will send you an email whenever your code is done building. This is a very bare-bones lightweight solution to needing to run your code remotely.

Because this runs on EWS, most of the programs this uses don't have to be installed manually. The only program you need to compile and install manually is [Aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha), which is used to convert build output into nice HTML that you can read. 

More detailed instructions to come soonâ„¢.
